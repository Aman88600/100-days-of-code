# This is the solution for Day 1, I am doing this a little early cause, I have to sleep soon and I want to make a commit

# 1. We Greet the user
print("Welcome to the Band Name Generator (Made by Aman Basoya).")
# 2. We take the name of the city using the input() function
city = input("What's the name of the city you grew up in? : ")
# 3. We Ask for the user's pet's name
pet_name = input("What's Your pet's name : ")
# 4. Finally Printing the Band name
band_name = f"{city} {pet_name}"
print(f"Your Band Name could be {band_name}")
