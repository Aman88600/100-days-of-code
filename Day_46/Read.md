# You don't need to clone the entire repo
- You only need the get_100_songs.py, main.py and requiements.txt

# Make a .env file in the same folder and main.py
- Your .env should look like this
- CLIENT_ID = "77csdk;nscknc"
- CLIENT_SECRET = "48cincucbn"

# (Optional) Make a virtual environment
- python -m venv spotify_venv

# Install the required dependicies
pip install -r requirements.txt

# If your API credentials are correct then run main.py
- python main.py(If eveerything goes right, enjoy your songs and maybe, give a star to my repo)
